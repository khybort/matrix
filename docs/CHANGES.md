## 2026-05-23 — Bootstrap (initial author: assistant, on behalf of user)

- Foundation docs created: `VISION.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `WORK_SPLIT.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` written with two-machine instructions
- Monorepo skeleton scaffolded (pnpm workspace)
- Tech stack defaults locked in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Next.js 16 + Python 3.13 + Neon + pgvector + AGE)

## 2026-05-23 — Pivot: trading-first, local-first, node-based

User clarified priorities after seeing the initial foundation. Three changes:

1. **Local-first**: removed Neon dependency. Local Postgres via `docker compose up -d`. Cloud (Neon + Vercel) only when bulletin product launches in Phase 6+. Added `docker-compose.yml` + `infra/db/Dockerfile` (apache/age + pgvector layered).
2. **Node-based**: dropped the fixed "Machine A / Machine B" model. Now `N` nodes can be added; each declares roles in `.matrix-node.json`. See revised `docs/WORK_SPLIT.md`.
3. **Trading-first**: bulletin product deferred to Phase 6+. Primary product is the autonomous self-improving trading system. New `docs/TRADING.md` with code-enforced risk framework. Roadmap rewritten around Phase 1-5 = build-then-paper-trade-then-small-live.

First market choice: **crypto perpetuals** (Bybit testnet) — 24/7 markets, low-friction testnet, smaller minimum capital, simpler regulatory positioning than equity options.

Next action: Phase 1 begins. First concrete coding task = bring up local DB + smoke-test Python service that writes a row.
